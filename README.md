## Description

This project is a system which focuses on shared accommodation management. The intent for this management system is to have a centralized platform, which is tailored towards addressing the needs of users living in communal living space. Living in a shared accommodation often comes with a set of challenges which can have varying effects on the living experience for the roommates. Our goal is to address these challenges by streamlining tasks and improving communication. This repository contains the frontend part of the project.
